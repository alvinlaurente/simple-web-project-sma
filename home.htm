		<font face=Arial>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>mocktail (n.)</b><i> A cocktail containing no alcohol (A non-alcoholic cocktail)</i><br><br>
		<center><img src="img/mocktails1.jpg" class=img1><br></center>
		<p align=left>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt's always fun to offer something at parties that it is delightful to drink. 
		For over a century now, many people have served a variety of cocktails which mix various flavors, juices and the like 
		with alcohol in order to concoct delicious, but heady drinks. Of course not everyone drinks. Alcohol isn't usually 
		given to children, some people abstain from alcohol because they formerly were alcoholics, many must avoid alcohol 
		for medical reasons, and others are teetotalers and have religious prescriptions against drinking. 
		The mocktail is a perfect solution for such folk.<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Essentially a mocktail is any cocktail without the alcohol. 
		There are a number of drinks that easily convert to becoming mocktails, while others may not taste so good. 
		For instance, not every palate appreciates tonic water served with a slice of lemon. Most mocktails rely on sodas, 
		or fruity flavors in order to be appealing. There are also some mocktail types that were never originally cocktails, 
		like the Shirley Temple, a combination of grenadine and lemon-lime soda.<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Some of the best mocktail drinks are fruity ones. It's easy to make virgin versions of most 
		daiquiris or margaritas. People may not even miss the tequila in a strawberry margarita mocktail, or complain about 
		the lack of rum in a virgin banana daiquiri.<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A non-alcoholic beverage is a beverage that contains no alcohol. 
		Non-alcoholic mixed drinks (including punches, "virgin cocktails", or "mocktails") 
		are often consumed by children, people whose religion restricts alcohol consumption, 
		recovering alcoholics, and anyone wishing to enjoy flavorful drinks without alcohol. 
		They are often available as alternative beverages in contexts (such as bars) where the 
		norm is to drink alcoholic beverages. Examples include Shirley Temples, Virgin Marys, and virgin-style Pina Coladas. 
		Non-alcoholic beverages contain no more than 5% alcohol by volume. 
		The category includes drinks that traditionally have no trace of alcohol such as sodas, juices, and sparkling ciders. 
		It also includes drinks that have undergone an alcohol removal process such as non-alcoholic beers and 
		dealcoholized wines.<br><br></p></font>

		<font face="Monotype Corsiva" size=30 color=green><center>Mocktail Benefits</font><br><br>
		<font face="Arial"><p align=left><b>Fewer calories</b><br>
		Alcoholic drinks, sugary mixed drinks or fruity, frozen concoctions, can affix copious calories to your daily tally 
		(and, if you're really intoxicated, lead to binge eating caused by poor judgment), adding up to excess pounds in the 
		long run.
		The average mixed drink made with one ounce of rum, vodka or whiskey and juice or cola clocks in at over 200 calories. 
		Times that by two or three over the course of the evening and you'll have to run an extra houron the treadmill just 
		to burn it off!<br><br>
		<b>Less Expensive</b><br>
		Mocktails, especially those flavoured with just a splash of juice and / or diet tonic for example can cut the calorie 
		count down to just 50 calories while still providing plenty of flavour. 
		Mocktails cut out the most expensive ingredient - the alcohol - whether you're making them from scratch or ordering 
		out. This means you get to sip a satisfying drink and line your pockets with extra cash while you're at it.<br><br>
		<b>Higher in Nutrients</b><br>
		Mocktails made with fresh and/or organic juices, such as pomegranate, orange, mango, cranberry boast plenty of 
		antioxidants and vitamin C and none of the corn syrup found in colas or many drink mixers.<br><br>
		<b>Everyone can enjoy them</b><br>
		Pregnant women, people on specific medications or with chronic illnesses, designated drivers; children and even 
		the most devout prohibitionists can all enjoy mocktails, making your next party or dinner gathering exceptionally 
		enticing to drinkers and those who don't drink alcohol alike.<br></p></font>

		<font face="Monotype Corsiva" size=30 color=green><center>Mocktail Glasses</font><br><br>
		<font face="Arial"><p align=left>Because mocktail almost the same as the cocktail (the different is just the mixture of 
		alcohol in a cocktail and no alcohol on mocktail), mocktail using the same glass with the glasses worn by cocktail.
		There are some different kinds of cocktail glasses and we will show you Cocktail Glass Guide.<br><br>
		
		Here we describe most of the cocktail glasses you might find in a well-equipped bar. 
		The professional bartender will usually prepare the cocktail in the 'right' glass. 
		So a martini will be served in a martini glass and a Bloody Mary in a highball glass.
		For the rest of us, well, any glass will do. This is a guide to the glasses that are available for making cocktails. 
		Remember, nothing stops you from making any cocktail in any glass. As with most things in the world of mixology, 
		we recommend that you experiment with various drinks in various glasses. 
		The bottom line is, you don't have to have all of these glasses to make masterful cocktails. 
		You will go far with a few highball, lowball, wine and shot glasses. 
		Having a few cocktail glasses and champagne flutes will take you 99% there. 
		A general rule of thumb is, the stronger the drink, the smaller the glass. But, this is also just a guideline! 
		You might notice that some other glassware guides have different names for different glasses. 
		For example, some refer to a martini glass as a "cocktail glass" and others refer to a cocktail glass as a "margarita glass".<br><br>

		<b>TIP</b>: Always handle a glass by its stem (if it has one). This prevents your hand from warming the drink. 
		It also prevents fingermarks on the glass.<br><br>
